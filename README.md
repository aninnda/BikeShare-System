# Overview
This project is a Bike Sharing Management System (BMS) developed as part of SOEN 343 – Software Architecture and Design at Concordia University.
The system simulates a real-world bike-sharing service, allowing riders to reserve, unlock, ride, and return bikes, while operators manage stations, bikes, and system operations.

The project emphasizes software architecture, object-oriented design, UML modeling, and design patterns, following a multi-phase development process.

## Objectives

Design a scalable and layered software architecture

Apply object-oriented principles and design patterns

Model real-world domain concepts using UML

Implement core bike-sharing functionalities

Demonstrate clean separation of concerns across layers

Deliver a functional system aligned with documented use cases

## System Features
### User Roles

#### Rider

- Register and log in

- Reserve one bike at a time

- Check out and return bikes

- View ride history and billing information

- Receive notifications (reservation expiry, trip summary)

#### Operator

- Log in using a predefined operator profile

- Move and rebalance bikes between stations

- Mark bikes or stations as out of service

- View system-wide ride and billing data

- Receive alerts for system conditions (full/empty stations)

#### Guest
- View station map and pricing plans (read-only)
